# Live View: A Java Developer's Crystal Ball

## Overview

Ever wished you could peer into the heart of your application as it runs, watching the gears turn and the code dance? Welcome to the Live View feature, your application's reality show, where every method's performance is on display, timestamp and all. 

!!! tip
    This isn't just any feature. It's your front-row ticket to the inner workings of your code, filled with great insights into your code.

### Key Features

Every single execution of a method is called a ```Replay``` and with each ```Replay``` you will see the following:

1. **Real-Time Method Tracking**: Live View reveals each method call in the act, complete with the precise moment of its execution. It's like having surveillance cameras in your codebase, minus the creepy vibe.  (*Unlogged works fully offline and never sends your code/data to us.*)

2. **The Performance Wizard**: Ever wonder how long your methods take to perform their magic tricks? Live view shows the time taken to complete each method execution, in milliseconds. Click on the time icon in the replay, and you will see the time taken by each line!

3. **Quick Debugging**: On hover of each method in the live view you get to see the input arguments it juggled and the return value it pulled out of its hat. 

4. **Line-by-Line Code Coverage**: Click on the lines covered and the live view shows you exactly which lines of code it touched during its execution.
